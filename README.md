Overview of Research:
The researchers proposed MetaNet, a new ensembling technique for improved image classification. A common machine learning ensembling technique, known as boosting has been effective at improving an ensemble of weak models’ performance. However, the researchers modified the training process through proposing “complement blocks” to extend boosting to deep learning applications. Through complement blocks, models are trained and later stacked to form what is called “MetaNet”. On the popular CiFAR10 dataset and a breast cancer histopathology dataset, MetaNet outperformed the baseline models by between 3-4% and traditional ensembles by 0.5-2% in f1-score or accuracy. The initial validation suggests that this ensembling technique can improve researchers’ and institutions’ abilities to classify images or data across multiple fields, from everyday objects to medical images.
